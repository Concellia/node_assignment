# Node Challenges Assignment
#Challenge one.
 - Clone the repo in to your computer.
 - The first challenge javascript file is named node1.js
 - The first challenge spec file is named nod.spec.js under the spec folder
 - To initialise jasmine type npm test-init or npm run test-init on the terminal
 - To run the test type npm run test or npm test on the terminal
 N.B since the save() and getId() function are auto generated ensure that you are not trying to save files with the file name that already exists. This can be done by changing the expect value on the nod.spec.js file.
